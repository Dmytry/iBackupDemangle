# iBackupDemangle
Takes an unencrypted iTunes backup and renames filenames from their mangled names to the names they have on the iPhone. 

Works as of May 5 2019. 

Feel free to modify if you want an option to use hardlinks instead of renaming (so the original backup can still be used for restore).
